# Retinova-Capstone-C242-PS435

Retinova is an AI-powered mobile application for early detection of diabetic retinopathy (DR) using retinal images. This app aims to assist healthcare providers and individuals with diabetes in remote and underserved areas by enabling quick, reliable, and affordable screening using Android devices. The app analyzes retinal images to detect early signs of DR, providing users with preventive insights and personalized lifestyle recommendations.

## Features
- AI-Powered DR Detection: Uses deep learning models to analyze retinal images and detect DR.
- Offline Mode with TensorFlow Lite: Model inference directly on Android devices without requiring an internet connection.
- User-Friendly Interface: Simple design that allows easy capture and analysis of retinal images.
- Healthcare Integration: Option to share results with healthcare providers for follow-up.
- Secure Data Handling: User data is processed with privacy in mind, following healthcare and AI ethics.

## Tech Stack
- Android Studio: Main IDE for Android app development.
- TensorFlow Lite: For deploying and running the deep learning model on mobile devices.
- Python: Used for initial model training with TensorFlow and Keras.
- Google Colab: GPU support for deep learning model training.


## Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fazicoabryanda/Retinova-Capstone-C242-PS435.git
   ```

## Model Training and Conversion
1. Train the model on retinal images dataset using **Python** and **TensorFlow** in **Google Colab** or locally on Jupyter Notebook.
2. Convert the trained model to TensorFlow Lite:
   ```python
   # Example conversion code
   import tensorflow as tf
   model = tf.keras.models.load_model('path_to_your_model.h5')
   converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(model)
   tflite_model = converter.convert()
   with open('model.tflite', 'wb') as f:
       f.write(tflite_model)
   ```
3. Integrate `model.tflite` into the Android project (place in `assets` folder).

## Ethical Considerations
- Data Privacy: All user data is handled following HIPAA and GDPR guidelines.
- Transparency and Accountability**: The AI model is designed to ensure accuracy and fairness in its predictions.
- Healthcare Ethics: The app is intended to support, not replace, medical diagnosis by certified healthcare professionals.
